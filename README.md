# sdkdemo

This project is a basic example of how to use GelSightSDK. The SDK provides
functions and data structures for converting images from GelSight systems into
3D heightmaps. 

## Windows

This project assumes you have the `GS_SDK` environment variable set to the path
to your GelSightSdk folder. You also need a valid license for GelSightSdk.

 * Run the copysdk.bat script to copy the dlls from your GelSightSdk folder into the build directories
 * Open the solution and build

## Linux

This project assumes you have the `GS_SDK` environment variable set to the path
to your GelSightSdk folder. You also need a valid license for GelSightSdk.
